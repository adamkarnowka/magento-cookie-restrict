Extension for Magento developers, including:
* cookie based protection
* setting cookiename, lifetime
* IP whitelist supported (so Payone, etc can work even when site is offline)
* frontend blocked only, meaning image upload should work
* hash-protected guestpass URL, which can be used to grant permissions
* adding unique timestamp for static files (css, js).
* multistore support
